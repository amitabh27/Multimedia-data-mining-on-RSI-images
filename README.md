# Multimedia data mining on RSI images

  IEEE paper implemented : Peano Count Tree Association rule Mining.
  
  
  Using C and Java Swings, the algorithm was designed to mine the visual bands of RSI images at bit level so that association rules can be derived between a set of satellite images.
  The algorithm was fed with an event's image and a contributing factor's image that contributes towards the success of the event.Say Rainfall and crop yield and then rules were mined to study how yield is affected by rainfall.So that given a rainfall image of a different geographical region,the yield over there could be predicted.
