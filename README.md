    Using C and Java Swings, the algorithm was designed to mine the visual bands of RSI images 
    at bit level so that association rules can be derived between a set of satellite images.
    The algorithm was fed with an event's image and a contributing factor's image that contributes 
    towards the success of the event.Say Rainfall and crop yield and then rules were mined to study 
    how yield is affected by rainfall.So that given a rainfall image of a different geographical 
    region, the yield over there could be predicted.
